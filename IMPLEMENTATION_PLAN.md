# Traffic Simulation Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to evolve the current traffic simulation into a complex and feature-rich application. Each step includes a clear goal and a prompt that can be given to a developer to implement the feature.

## Step 1: Integrate the Road Editor with the Simulation

*   **Goal:** Combine the road editor and the traffic simulation into a single application. The user should be able to draw a road network and then run a simulation on it.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Currently, the road editor and the traffic simulation are two separate pages. Your task is to merge them. Modify the `index.html` and `main.js` files to include the road editing functionality from `road-editor.html` and `road-editor.js`. The user should be able to first draw a network of roads and then click a "Start Simulation" button to see cars driving on the roads they've created."

## Step 2: Implement Car Spawning at Nodes

*   **Goal:** Cars should be created dynamically at the nodes (intersections) of the road network.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Right now, cars are hard-coded to start at specific locations. Modify the code so that cars are spawned at the nodes of the road network. You should create a "spawn point" at each node that periodically generates a new car. The car should then begin to drive along a random, connected road."

## Step 3: Advanced Pathfinding for Vehicles

*   **Goal:** Cars should be able to navigate the road network from a starting point to a destination.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's) to allow cars to navigate the road network. When a car is created, it should be assigned a random destination node. The car should then follow the shortest path to its destination. Once it arrives, it should be removed from the simulation."

## Step 4: Basic Collision Detection with Other Vehicles

*   **Goal:** Implement a more robust collision detection system that prevents cars from driving through each other.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "The current collision detection is very basic. Upgrade the system so that cars can detect other cars in front of them and adjust their speed to avoid collisions. A car should slow down or stop if there is another car in its path and resume its speed when the path is clear."

## Step 5: Implement Traffic Lights at Intersections

*   **Goal:** Add traffic lights to the intersections to control the flow of traffic.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Introduce traffic lights at the intersections (nodes). The traffic lights should cycle through green, yellow, and red states, allowing traffic to flow in some directions while stopping it in others. Cars should obey the traffic signals, stopping for red lights and proceeding on green."

## Step 6: Introduce Different Vehicle Types

*   **Goal:** Add a variety of vehicles to the simulation, each with different characteristics.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Expand the `Car` class to support different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, buses). Each vehicle type should have unique properties, such as size, speed, and acceleration. The simulation should be able to render the different vehicle shapes and have them behave according to their properties."

## Step 7: Add a Scoring System

*   **Goal:** Add a scoring system to the simulation.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Introduce a scoring system that will increase each time a car reaches its destination. The final score will be displayed at the end of the simulation, which will be 5 minutes long."

## Step 8: Add a Reset and Restart Button

*   **Goal:** Add a reset button to restart the simulation.
*   **Prompt:**
    > "Introduce a reset button that will restart the simulation. The timer and the score will also be restarted, and the cars will be removed, and the simulation will start from the beginning."
