# Traffic Motorway Simulator

A web-based simulator for visualizing traffic flow and congestion on motorways.

## Description

This project aims to provide a platform for users to simulate and observe traffic dynamics. Users can adjust various parameters to see their effects on traffic flow, congestion, and overall motorway performance. This tool is designed for educational purposes, traffic analysis, and for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of traffic behavior.

## Features

*   **Real-time Traffic Simulation:** Watch traffic flow on a motorway in real-time.
*   **Parameter Adjustment:** Modify parameters such as the number of vehicles, vehicle speed, and road conditions.
*   **Congestion Simulation:** Observe how traffic jams form and dissipate under different conditions.
*   **Data Visualization:** (Future) View graphs and charts of key traffic metrics like average speed and vehicle density.

## Built With

This project is a web-based game and utilizes the following technologies:

*   [Two.js](http://two.js.org/) - A two-dimensional drawing api for the web.
